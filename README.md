Intro
---------------------
Securechain wallet is the official Securecoin wallet. Securecoin is a
free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending. It is secured by six different algorithms and its CPU only mining is another security strength. 


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt5 run-time and probably boost libraries to run Securechain Wallet. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5`

This release supports all Windows, Mac and Linux compilation.
